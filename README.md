# Give me the Binary!
The project focuses on creating a simple game, based on an Arduino Uno board.
The system consists of a LED screen, four green LEDs, a red one, four buttons and a potentiometer.
The aim of the game is to convert a given number from decimal base to binary base in a given time, decreasing through consecutive rounds. When the number isn't converted correctly, the game ends.
